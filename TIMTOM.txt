  msg $chan 4,11Hey all!  It's been a joy serving you these past few days.  Though we've lost a bit of ground in terms of new memberships, we've all become closer and better good friends and that's what counts here. The wheel is still #1 as it should be.    
  msg $chan 5,11Some of out newest features include: 1,13death!5,11  0,3life!5,11  1,7piegs!5,11  and after a great deal of fighting, we've finally decided to allow our members to use the word "buffelo".  However, once must include the phrase "msl strip_buf" somewhere in his message in order for TIMTOM to agree.  Enjoy friends.
